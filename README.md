First in Tech experts:language and terminology you use precise,industry specific terms and assume prior knowledge,depth of explanation focus on advanced details,efficiency and in depth analysis and lastly in assumed knowledge assume familiarity with foundational concept and focus on innovation.In Regular folk,language and terminology use simplified lamhuage and avoid jargon and also explain concepts in everyday terms,in depth of explanation provide step by step explanation,analogies and real world examples and lastly in assumed knowledge start with the basics and gradually build up understanding.

Simplifying terms makes writing clearer,easier to understand and more approachable .Example use everyday words instead of complex terms like "please initiate the installation process" say 'please start the installation",avoid unnecessary jargon like "the system will authenicate your credentials" use "the system will check your logn details".This matters because it impacts on the better accessibility in that more people can understand,it also improves engagement sincereaders have gasped some content and lastly for faster comorehension where readers do not have to pause and decode the meaning.
